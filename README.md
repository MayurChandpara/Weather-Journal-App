# Weather Journal App
---
This project focuses on getting the **API** set up for weather data. And this also uses the **user feed** to add entry to the specific searched entry. This whole project is having _Node-Express_ environment. In this I have used _Body-parser, cors & express_.

## UI Contains:
---
1.  Zip Input field.
2.  Feed Entry Textarea field to express the current feeing for the weather.
3.  Button to generate the data.
4.  The API uses the API-key for the website of openweathermap.
5.  The result is displayed on the same page but using different routes for data interchange.

### Thank YOU

Any suggestions are most welcomed to make this more polished.
